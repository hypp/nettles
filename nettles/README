About
========================
Nettles is a program that adds TLS support to
legacy applications without modification.

It can work in three different modes:
- client only
The client application does not support TLS.
- server only
The server application does not support TLS.
- client and server
Neither the client nor the server application supports TLS.

See the examples dir.

Compiling
========================
Currently builds on:
* OS X
* Windows

Nettles is built using SCons
http://www.scons.org/

SCons requires Python
http://www.scons.org/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#What_version_of_Python_do_I_need.3F

On Windows both MSYS and MinGW is required
http://www.mingw.org/

There are 3 third party libs (included)
libevent, lua and Polarssl

When compiling Nettles, SCons will try to build the dependecies,
but if it fails you will have to manually build them.

Building on OS X:
Start a terminal
cd /path/to/nettles
/path/to/scons

Building on Windows:
Start a command prompt
cd /path/to/nettles
/path/to/scons.bat path_to_msys=/path/to/msys/bin


Running
========================
Just run
./nettles client-nettles.lua

Configuration
========================
There is not very much to configure.
See the examples dir.
