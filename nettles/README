About
========================
Nettles is a program that adds TLS support to
legacy applications without modification.

It can work in three different modes:
- client only
The client application does not support TLS.
- server only
The server application does not support TLS.
- client and server
Neither the client nor the server application supports TLS.

See the examples dir.

Building
========================
Currently builds on:
* OS X
* Windows
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 64-bit and 32-bit

Nettles is built using SCons
http://www.scons.org/

SCons requires Python
http://www.scons.org/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#What_version_of_Python_do_I_need.3F

On Windows both MSYS and MinGW is required
http://www.mingw.org/

On Linux readline-devel is required
On RHEL 6.4: sudo yum install readline-devel

When compiling Nettles, SCons will try to build the dependecies,
but if it fails you will have to manually build them.

There are 3 third party libs (included)
libevent, lua and Polarssl

Building on OS X:
Start a terminal
cd /path/to/nettles
/path/to/scons

Building on Windows:
Start a command prompt
cd /path/to/nettles
/path/to/scons.bat path_to_msys=/path/to/msys/bin

Building on Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
Start a terminal
cd /path/to/nettles
/path/to/scons

Running
========================
