About
========================
Nettles is a program that adds TLS support to
legacy applications without modification.

It can work in three different modes:
- client only
The client application does not support TLS.
- server only
The server application does not support TLS.
- client and server
Neither the client nor the server application supports TLS.

See the examples dir.
